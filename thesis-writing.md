Do say that something is "interesting". 
===
Using it simply means that you didn't have the time to think clearly about what you say. 
See the following examples: 

  > In the last two articles, there were interesting ways to extract various data from the analyzed systems.

  > In the case of monoliths, the number of configuration files that are required changes exten- sively, it proves an interesting study point. 


Be precise in what you write.
====

  > We propose a semi-automatic tool that supporst architects in decision making and whole system visualization **without too many obstacles**.

This is vague. What does it mean without too many obstacles? Be precise: are there obstactles? Then how many? Which are they? 

Also, besides being imprecise, it's also **your opinion**. Maybe for you it's not **too many obstacles** but for somebody else they are. Always talk about facts in a thesis rather than opinions.
