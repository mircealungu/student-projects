The following are a few rules that I would like you to respect before submitting 
any written work to me. Practice these rules on your thesis and any in other technical
report. Being a good writer is an important skill in any context you might end up in,
not only in the university. 


Don't Submit a Text with Grammatical Mistakes and Typos
===

I am not your English teacher. I willÂ stop reading a thesis that has too 
many spelling and grammar errors. 

Everybody makes mistakes, and in fifty pages, it is normal that mistakes 
will sneak in. However, you have no excuse for spelling errors that
are so simple that could have been caught by an automatic spellchecker. 
E.g.

> __This aspects__ affects not only large projects but also small ones.

Did you mean "this aspect" or "these aspects"? I can't focus on the 
important idea that you're trying to convey if I'm stopping at every
sentence wondering what did you mean. And you want my feedback on the
important, high-level ideas in your thesis, not on your English. 

**How to Ensure This**: Have a native English speaker review your text. If you can't 
do that, at least run your text through a grammarly and the Word and spellchecker 
before submitting your first draft. 
1. For Grammarly create a free account on [app.grammarly.com](app.grammarly.com).
Use the web application, not the chorme extension. You don't have to get the 
paid version: if you address the observations in the free version, your text
should already be much more readable. 
2. Word will catch some problems that Grammarly will not, so please paste your 
text in it too and take care of the highlighted problems. 


Keep Sentences Short
===

You're not Stephen King. Keep your sentences simple if you
want to make the text understandable.

**How to Ensure This**: Pass your text through the [Hemingway editor](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)
to ensure that you keep your sentences short. If they are too long, 
refactor them by removing useless words, refactoring passive voice into 
active voice, and ultimately splitting them in smaller sentences. 




Remove Useless Words
===

Compare the following two sentences: 

 > Due to the nature of the project it is worth mentioning that software dependencies can be represented as a graph. A similar concept is used by Cox et al. in which he presents the dependency term.  
 
 > Cox et al. argues that software dependencies can be represented as a graph. 
 
They say the same thing: one in a very convoluted way, the other in a straightforward way. 
Which is better? Which is more clear? Which one is more powerful?

Apply the Single Responsibility Principle to Paragraphs
===

Just as in software we like our modules to have a single responsibility, so should our writing units.
- A paragraph should be about one idea. 
- A Section should be a series of related paragraphs.

Before submitting your thesis, re-read it and make sure that your paragraphs 
are cohesive. If they are not, then split them, until they are cohesive.

Write Facts Not Opinions
====

Scientific writing is about facts not opinions. It is about data, not about your own viewpoints. There is a single place in your thesis where you are invited to write your opinions, and that is the Discussion or Conclusion section. Until then, stick to the facts. 

  > We propose a semi-automatic tool that supporst architects in decision making and whole system visualization **without too many obstacles**.

Maybe for you it's not **too many obstacles** but for somebody else they are. Always talk about facts in a thesis rather than opinions. In this case, to make this concrete you would have to be precise: how many obstacles? which are they? Or simply, drop the discussion about obstacles if you can't say anything about it at this point. 



The Word "Interesting" Should Never Appear In a Thesis
===
Saying that something is *interesting* simply means that you were too lazy to think clearly about what you wanted to say. 
See the following examples: 

  > In the last two articles, there were **interesting** ways to extract various data from the analyzed systems.

  > In the case of monoliths, the number of configuration files that are required changes extensively, it proves an **interesting** study point. 

It might be interesting for you but not for me. Ultimately that something is interesting, it's your opinion. Thus, either think deep about what are the facts that you thought were interesting, and list them. Or just drop this opinion sentence alltogether.
