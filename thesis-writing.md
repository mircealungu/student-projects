Do say that something is "interesting". 
===
Using it simply means that you didn't have the time to think clearly about what you say. 
See the following examples: 

  > In the last two articles, there were interesting ways to extract various data from the analyzed systems.

  > In the case of monoliths, the number of configuration files that are required changes exten- sively, it proves an interesting study point. 


A thesis contains facts, not opinions.
====

Scientific writing is about facts not opinions. It is about data, not about your own viewpoints. There is a single place in your thesis where you are invited to write your opinions, and that is the Discussion or Conclusion section. Until then, stick to the facts. 

  > We propose a semi-automatic tool that supporst architects in decision making and whole system visualization **without too many obstacles**.

Maybe for you it's not **too many obstacles** but for somebody else they are. Always talk about facts in a thesis rather than opinions. In this case, to make this concrete you would have to be precise: how many obstacles? which are they? Or simply, drop the discussion about obstacles if you can't say anything about it at this point.
