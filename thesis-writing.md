Compare the following two sentences: 

 > Due to the nature of the project it is worth mentioning that software dependencies can be represented as a graph. A similar concept is used by Cox et al. in which he presents the dependency term.  
 
 > Cox et al. argues that software dependencies can be represented as a graph. 
 
They say the same thing: one in a very convoluted way, the other in a straightforward way. 
Which is better? Which is more clear? Which one is more powerful?

Single Responsibility Principle Applied to Paragraphs
===

Just as in software we like our modules to have a single responsibility, so should our writing units.
- A paragraph should be about one idea. 
- A Section should be a series of related paragraphs.

Before submitting your thesis, re-read it and make sure that your paragraphs 
are cohesive. If they are not, then split them, until they are cohesive.

A thesis contains facts, not opinions.
====

Scientific writing is about facts not opinions. It is about data, not about your own viewpoints. There is a single place in your thesis where you are invited to write your opinions, and that is the Discussion or Conclusion section. Until then, stick to the facts. 

  > We propose a semi-automatic tool that supporst architects in decision making and whole system visualization **without too many obstacles**.

Maybe for you it's not **too many obstacles** but for somebody else they are. Always talk about facts in a thesis rather than opinions. In this case, to make this concrete you would have to be precise: how many obstacles? which are they? Or simply, drop the discussion about obstacles if you can't say anything about it at this point. 



The word "interesting" should never appear in a thesis
===
Saying that something is *interesting* simply means that you were too lazy to think clearly about what you wanted to say. 
See the following examples: 

  > In the last two articles, there were **interesting** ways to extract various data from the analyzed systems.

  > In the case of monoliths, the number of configuration files that are required changes extensively, it proves an **interesting** study point. 

It might be interesting for you but not for me. Ultimately that something is interesting, it's your opinion. Thus, either think deep about what are the facts that you thought were interesting, and list them. Or just drop this opinion sentence alltogether.
