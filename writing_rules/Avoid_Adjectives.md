# Avoid Adjectives

Adjectives are usually your opinions or judgements. Use them sparingly if at all. 

In a scientific text you should keep opinions for the *Discussion* section. Everywhere else, stick to facts.

> In these meetings we had *fruitful* discussions...

If you think your meetings were *fruitful* then instead of simply writing that, maybe highlight three things that the reader will understand are important that came out of those meetings. Then the user will understand that the meetings were fruitful.  


Or look at the use of *abysmally* in the following example:

> The statistics were *abysmally* down on the settings page. 

Is *abysmally* really needed in the previous example? 
Do you want to get into a debate with the reader whether the positioning of the settings was *abysmally* down or *quite* down? I don't think so.  

Even if the text was less exagerate, e.g. *too much down on the settings page* - you're setting yourself for a debate: why was it too much down. If this is important, then explain it and let the user realize themselves that it was *too much down*. Show, don't tell.
