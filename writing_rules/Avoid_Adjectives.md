# Avoid Adjectives


> The statistics were *abysmally* down on the settings page. 

Is *abysmally* really needed in the previous example? 
Do you want to get into a debate with the reader whether the positioning of the settings was just down on the page or *abysmally* down? I don't think so.  

Even if the text was less exagerate, e.g. *too much down on the settings page* - you're setting yourself for a debate: why was it too much down. If this is important, then explain it and let the user realize themselves that it was *too much down*. Show, don't tell. 

Adjectives are usually your opinions or judgements. Use them sparingly if at all. 
In a scientific text you should keep opinions for the *Discussion* section. Everywhere else, stick to facts.
