# Keep Sentences Short

Keep your sentences short if you want to make the text understandable.
And you do want understandable text: because that's the entire point of writing - to communicate.

*How to Ensure This*: Pass your text through the [Hemingway editor](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) to ensure that you keep your sentences short. If they are too long, refactor them by removing useless words, refactoring passive voice into active voice, and ultimately splitting them in smaller sentences.
