The Single Responsibility Principle for Text

Just as in software we like our modules to have a single responsibility, so should our writing units.

* A paragraph should be about one topic.
* A Section should be a series of related paragraphs.

**How to Ensure This**: Before submitting your thesis, re-read it and make sure that your paragraphs are cohesive. If they are not, then split them, until they are cohesive.
