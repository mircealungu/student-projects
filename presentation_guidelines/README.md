# Presenting a thesis

## Presentation Structure
- The presentation is an exercise in showing that you know how to extract the essence from a work - so keep it short 7 to 15 minutes maximum and talk about the essential findings.
- Evidently, besides the findings you have to make a concrete compelling case for why the problem that you're trying to solve is important. Describe while your solution.
- Add a discussion where you step back and you criticize your own work that's what the discussion is about showing.
- What are the limitations of the work?
- Make sure to, and just like in the face with three important future research directions think about them as what would be the next three masters that you would supervise in this domain.
- Make sure that if you include images, the font in the images is needed too small not too big but the right size compared to the text that surrounds it


## Small Details (that matter)
- Add slide numbers - that makes it easy for the audience to ask you to go back to specific slide and ask a question about it
- The last slide is very often the slide that stays the most on the screen, so make sure to transform it into a visual summary of everything that you talked about rather than just putting a thank you on it; that is a real waste of an opportunity
