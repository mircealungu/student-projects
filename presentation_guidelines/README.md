# Presenting a thesis


## Presentation Structure

- The presentation is an exercise in showing that you know how to extract the essence from a work - so keep it short: 7 to 15 minutes maximum and talk about the essential findings.

- Besides the findings, you have to make a concrete, compelling case for why the problem that you're trying to solve is important. Describe your solution.

- Add a discussion where you step back and criticize your own work - that's what the discussion is about.
What are the limitations of the work? This is the place where you show that you are not ignorant of the fact that your work is not perfect

- Make sure to include three important future research directions. Think about them as what would be the next three master's theses you would supervise in this domain.

## Small Details (that matter)

- Add slide numbers - that makes it easy for the audience to ask you to go back to a specific slide and ask a question about it.
- The last slide very often stays on the screen the longest, so make sure to transform it into a visual summary of everything you talked about rather than just putting a "thank you" on it; that is a real waste of an opportunity.
- Make sure that if you include images, the font in the images is neither too small nor too big, but the right size compared to the text that surrounds it.
