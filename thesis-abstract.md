# Abstract as the four-sentence-summary, by Kent Beck

Recommended structure for a good abstract:

1. The problem
2. Why the problem is a problem
3. My startling sentence
4. The implication of my startling sentence

The reason for this, explained by Kent Beck:

The abstract is your four sentence summary of the conclusions of your paper. Its primary purpose is to get your paper into the A pile. Most PC members sort their papers in an A pile and a B pile by reading the abstracts. The A pile papers get smiling interest, the B pile papers are a chore to be slogged through. By keeping your abstract short and clear, you greatly enhance your chances of being in the A pile. I try to have four sentences in my abstract. The first states the problem. The second states why the problem is a problem. The third is my startling sentence. The fourth states the implication of my startling sentence. An abstract for this paper done in this style would be:


> The rejection rate for OOPSLA papers in near 90%. Most papers are rejected not because of a lack of good ideas, but because they are poorly structured. Following four simple steps in writing a paper will dramatically increase your chances of acceptance. If everyone followed these steps, the amount of communication in the object community would increase, improving the rate of progress.


Well, I'm not sure that's a great abstract, but you get the idea. I always feel funny writing an abstract this way. The idea I thought was so wonderful when I started writing the paper looks naked and alone sitting there with no support. I resist the temptation to argue for my conclusion in the abstract. I think it gives the reader more incentive to carefully read the rest of the paper. They want to find you how in the world you could possible say such an outrageous thing. There are my four steps to better papers. You can use them sequentially to write papers, or you can use them to evaluate papers you have already written.

## Mircea's Comment to Kent Beck's Abstract

Often, when doing empirical software engineering research you'll have to also propose a research question.

If you look at the above abstract youâ€™ll see that the RQ can be then obtained by reversing the third sentence. In the abstract example from Kent Beck that would be something like: 

> Can following four steps in writing an abstract increase the chances of a paper being accepted at OOPSLA?
