# Introduction

There are multiple kinds of thesis.



# Design Thinking Kind of Thesis

## Problem

- Make it clear that there's a problem.
- That it's important.
- By the end of this, the reader should be curious: how could you solve this problem!
- If you don't identify a clear problem, you can't find the related work; you likely won't have a clear solution 

At ITU identifying a clear problem is a [goal](https://itustudent.itu.dk/study-administration/project-work/project-goals) of any individual or group project. 

## Related Work

- This is thepart where you report on how did others attempt to solve the problem that you have identified. 

- Heuristic: in the related work section you're showing the breadth of your knowledge about the related work. There is usually at least one related work discussed per paragraph if not sentence. If you discover that you're writing multiple paragraphs for a single work, you might be missing a background section maybe.


## Solution

	Describe your solution.


## Evaluation

## Discussion
