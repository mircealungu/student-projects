# Keep Figures Close To Corresponding Text

Do your best to keep the text and the corresponding figures close to each other. 
Ideally the figure and the explanatory text should be on the same page. Rarely it can be on a different page, but there has to be a strong reason for that. 

Tricks that you can use to bring figures closer to text:

- in LaTeX you can use the [h!] parameter for includegraphics

**Hint:** In extreme cases, you can start a new section on a new page early (and thus leave some extra empty space at the bottom of a page) in order to allow a figure and associated text to be on the same page. A reader will be thankful if he does not have to go back and forth in your document.
