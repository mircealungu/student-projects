# Keep Figures Close To Corresponding Text

Do your best to keep the text and the corresponding figures close to each other. 
Ideally the figure and the explanatory text should be on the same page. Rarely it can be on a different page, but there has to be a strong reason for that. 

Tricks that you can use to bring figures closer to text:

- in LaTeX you can use the [h!] parameter for includegraphics

In extreme cases, you can leave some extra empty space at the bottom of the page in order to allow the next figure and associated text to be on the same page.
