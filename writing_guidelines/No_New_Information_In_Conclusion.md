Don't Introduce New Information in Conclusion
=======

> "Don't surprise the reader with new information in your Conclusion that was never referenced anywhere else in the paper. If you have new information to present, add it to the Discussion or other appropriate section of the paper.  Note that, although no actual new information is introduced, the conclusion is where you offer your most "original" contributions in the paper; it's where you describe the value of your research, demonstrate your understanding of the material that youâ€™ve presented, and locate your findings within the larger context of scholarship on the topic."
