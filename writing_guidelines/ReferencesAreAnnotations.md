# References are Annotations 


They are not part of the text. 
This means that you should be able to read the sentence and it should sound perfectly grammatical even if that reference is missing. 

Instead of: 

> The employee data set is obtained from a this GitHub repository: [28].

rather write:

> The employee data set is obtained from the FancyTool GitHub repository [28].


And instead of: 

> Visualisation of distributed systems is an important topic with [6] taking an interest in runtime discovery  

Rather write: 

> Visualisation of distributed systems is an important topic with Somebodyson [6] taking an interest in runtime discovery
