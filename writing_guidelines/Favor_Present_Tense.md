# Favor Present Tense

We use past tense for stories.

We use present tense for describing processes, facts, and knowledge. 

A thesis or a paper is not a story. The reader does not care about your journey [1]. They care about the knowledge you are sharing with them. And maybe about how to replicate or verify that knowledge. 

Thus you write it in present tense in the attempt to remind the reader that it is knowledge that they are reading.


[1] The main idea also in [The Rational Design Process and How to Fake It](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/education/SE-Intro/fakeit.pdf) in which  David Parnas argues that also software documentation should be written in the same was as mathematical proofs are: nobody writes the proof in the longwinded ways in which they discovered it but rather they write it as if they saw the perfect solution from the beginning.
