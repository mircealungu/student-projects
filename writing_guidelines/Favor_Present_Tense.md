# Favor Present Tense

We use past tense for stories.

We use present tense for describing processes, facts, knowledge, and data. 

A thesis is not a story. The reader does not care about your journey. They care about the knowledge you gained, and about how to replicate or verify that knowledge. Thus you write it in present tense in the attempt to reminnd the reader that this is knowledge that they are reading.
