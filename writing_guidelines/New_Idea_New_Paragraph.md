# New Idea - New Paragraph

A paragraph should be focused on a single idea. 
Consequently, when the focus of the discussion changes, start a new paragraph. Always.

It is better to have two short paragraphs with two different ideas than one paragraph with two distinct ideas. 

One way to ensure that you keep focused paragraphs is to use [topic sentences](https://wts.indiana.edu/writing-guides/paragraphs-and-topic-sentences.html). These are sentences that are placed at the beginning of the paragraph and provide, in a concise manner, the main idea of the paragraph. This main idea is then expanded throughout the paragraph with further sentences that are supporting the main idea. Consequently, when you have a sentence that does not support the topic sentence, it might be time to start a new paragraph.
