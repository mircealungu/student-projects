# Do Not Address the Reader


From a student submission. 

> Our prototype lets you build interactive web UIs using C. 

Who is *you* here? Me, the reviewer? Why would I care to build whatever using C? 

In scientific writing you're presenting facts. Not talking to the reader. Pretty much never actually. 

Also, using "you" is a sign that the text is not specific enough. 
If the writer thought a bit more to figure out who is the *you* in the previous example, the text would have also become more concrete, and thus stronger: 

> Our prototype lets *the database administrator* build an interactive web UIs...
