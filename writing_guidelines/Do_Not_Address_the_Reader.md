# Do Not Address the Reader

In scientific writing you're not supposed to address the reader. 


#### Example #1

> Our prototype lets you build interactive web UIs using C. 

Who is *you* here? Me, the reviewer? What if I don't want to build web UIs C but I want to learn about your approach? Then I can't identify. And you lose my interest. Do you want that? 

##### What to do instead? 
In Example #1 using "you" is also sign that the text is not specific enough; 
and that the writer didn't think enough about whom is that prototype for. 
Replacing the *you* with the actual role for whom the prototype was designed, would have also made the text more concrete, and thus stronger: 

> Our prototype lets *the database administrator* build interactive web UIs...


#### Example #2

> Letâ€™s try to add some weights to the graph

This sounds like I'm reading a children's story or a blog, not a scientific paper.



### Exceptions
In the rare occasions where you need to address the reader in their reader role, refer to their role rather than using the personal pronoun ("you")

> The reader of this thesis might view a demo video online at some.url.

sounds more professional than

> You can view a demo video online at some.url.

although you could just avoid it alltogether by writing:

> A demo video is available online at some.url.
