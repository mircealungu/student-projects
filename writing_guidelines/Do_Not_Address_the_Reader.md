# Do Not Address the Reader


From a student submission. 

> Our prototype lets you build interactive web UIs using C. 

Who is *you* here? Me, the reviewer? What if I don't want to build web UIs C but I want to learn about your approach? 

In scientific writing you're not talking to the reader. Pretty much never.

Also, using "you" is a sign that the text is not specific enough; 
and that the writer didn't think enough about whom is that prototype for. 
Replacing the *you* with the actual role for whom the prototype was designed, would have also made the text more concrete, and thus stronger: 

> Our prototype lets *the database administrator* build an interactive web UIs...
