# Do Not Address the Reader


From a student submission. 

> Our prototype lets you build interactive web UIs using C. 

Who is *you* here? Me, the reviewer? What if I don't want to build web UIs C but I want to learn about your approach? 

In scientific writing you're not addressing the reader. Never.

How to fix this? Well, in the above example using "you" is also sign that the text is not specific enough; 
and that the writer didn't think enough about whom is that prototype for. 
Replacing the *you* with the actual role for whom the prototype was designed, would have also made the text more concrete, and thus stronger: 

> Our prototype lets *the database administrator* build an interactive web UIs...



**Note:** In rare occasions one wants to address the reader in their reader role, call them by their role: 

> The reader of this thesis might view a demo video online...

sounds more professional than

> You can view a demo video online
