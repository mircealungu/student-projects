Write Facts Not Opinions
====


Scientific writing is about facts not opinions. It is about data, not about your own viewpoints. There is a single place in your thesis where you are invited to write your opinions, and that is the Discussion or Conclusion section. Until then, stick to the facts. 


#### Example

  > We propose a semi-automatic tool that supports architects in decision making and whole system visualization **without too many obstacles**.

Maybe for you it's not **too many obstacles** but for somebody else they are. In this case, to make this concrete you would have to be precise: how many obstacles? Which are they? Or simply, drop the **too many** quantifier. 


#### Example 
> Another model by Authorson is **more promising**. It focuses on three areas...

After removing the opinion this becomes:

> Authorson proposes a model that focuses on three areas...

### More Examples

> At this point, the tool has created a __very powerful__ data structure that can be used to derive __a lot__ of information and do __a lot__ of analysis.
