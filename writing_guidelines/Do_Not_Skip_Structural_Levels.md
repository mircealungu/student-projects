Do Not Skip Structural Levels
===

If any of your sections has a 0 in it's number you're doing it wrong.

The following structural organization of a thesis is broken:

- 7) Discussion
- 7.0.1) Threats to Validity
- 7.0.2) Observations

A chapter is formed of subchapters, not of sections.
Thus you probably wanted to have something like:

- 7) Discussion
- 7.1) Threats to Validity
- 7.2) Observations
