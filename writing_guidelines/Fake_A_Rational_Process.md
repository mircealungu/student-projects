# Fake a Rational Process 

In his seminal paper [A Rational Design Process](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~perry/education/SE-Intro/fakeit.pdf), 
Dave Parnas argues that when describing the software architecture of a system, one should not describe the trials and tribulations
that lead to the final solution, but rather describe it as it was perfectly executed from the beginning. The reader does not want
to know about the things you tried and didn't work. They only want to know about what works.

That is the same principle for doing a mathematical proof. You might have tried out many things, but the final proof that you 
submit for evaluation is clean, and shows the shortest path from the problem to the solution.

In your thesis, or scientific report you do the same. When you describe your solution, you  describe it as it were a rational 
process. You describe the minimum necessary for the reader to understand what you did. If there were forks in the path, and you
tried out something that didn't work out, that is probably better described in a Discussion section rather than in your Solution
section.
