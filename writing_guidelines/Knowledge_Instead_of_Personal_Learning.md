# Report Knowledge Instead of Personal Learning

The goal of any scientific text is to bring new and useful knowledge into the world. 

As such, when you write your scientific report you should always think about what is the useful knowledge that the reader can take away from your report at the end. (Usually this knowledge is condensed in a hypothesis. That is then proven in the work).

This also has implications on your writing and argumentation. 
How can your reader trust your conlusion? How can they use the knowledge? 

Examples: 

* That you yourself used your own prototype and it worked, that's not very useful knowledge. How am I going to use this knowledge as a reader? That a random group of people with your prototype can finish a given task twice as fast than a group which does not have your tool... Now that's useful knowledge. Now I know that there's a very high chance that some other random person using your tool could also become more efficient. 


* The challenges you went through in implementing a Chrome Extension are not useful knowledge. (The challenges that a random group of people go through, might be a different story). But let's say that you implemented an extension. The minimal architecture required for implementing a special kind of extension is knowledge. (but then you have to convince me that it's minimal). Or, the way people's behavior changes when using that particular extension is knowledge. 


An outcome of this is that you don't write a thesis as a chronological story; of we tried that; and then we tried that. 
Rather you leave out stuff, such that you focus is on supporting your thesis.
