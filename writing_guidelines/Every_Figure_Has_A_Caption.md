# Every Figure Has a Caption

The caption should describe the content of the figure in a concise manner.

This does not relieve the text from explaining the figure in detail; however, when the reader looks at a figure, the caption should already give them a high-level understanding of what they are looking at.

See why the caption below is bad? It does not summarize the figure at all.
