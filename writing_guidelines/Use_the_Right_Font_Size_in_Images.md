# Use the Right Font Size in Images

Font size in images should be comparable with the rest of the text in the document. 
If the font is too small or too large, resize image in such a way as to have the font match the font of the text. 

The image below is bad because the font in the diagram is much smaller than the font in the surrounding text. The reader has printed the text, or if they are reading on the screen, has set the font at a readable size, and automatically this image can't be read in that context. The reader is disturbed. Now they are upset with your sloppiness. This is not in your interest.

Just as annoying can be the text in a figure that is much larger than the surrounding text. Observe the font size in the caption. This is the font in the whole surrounding page. And then the HUGE screenshot. It can be really disturbing aestheticaly.

Or another example where the text of the image is much too large compared with the text on the page, and makes the figure look unprofesisonal: 

<img width="1065" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7887642-c664-49ce-af02-8a3ce57f5ffe" />
