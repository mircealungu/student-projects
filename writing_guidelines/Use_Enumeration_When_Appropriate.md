# Use Enumeration When Appropriate

If you find yourself writing "there are three ways to..." then follow that with an enumeration not with bullet points. 


E.g. There are three types of lists in LaTeX:

1. Enumerations 
2. Itemized lists
3. Descriptive lists

The niceness of this is that it allows you to improve the structure of your written document too. 

Everybody favors structure over a "big wall of text".
