# Never Use the Word "Interesting"

Saying that something is interesting simply means that you were too lazy to think clearly about what you wanted to say. 

List the facts that made you think it was interesting. Then I can make my own opinion if it's interesting or not. 

This because, something being interesting is an opinion (e.g. it might be interesting for you but not for the reviewer). In these examples, as a reader, I learn nothing:

> In the last two articles, there were *interesting ways to extract various data* from the analyzed systems.

> In the case of monoliths, the number of configuration files that are required changes extensively, it proves an *interesting study point*.
