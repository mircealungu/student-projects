# Never Use the Word "Interesting"

Saying that something is interesting simply means that you were too lazy to think clearly about what you wanted to say. 

List the facts that made you think it was interesting. Then I can make my own opinion if it's interesting or not. 


Look at the following usage of "interesting" in a student submission: 

> In the last two articles, there were *interesting ways to extract various data* from the analyzed systems.

As a reader I'm puzzled: Which ways? Why were they interesting?
