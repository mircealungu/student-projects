Elements In A List Should Be Of the Same Kind
===

Consider the following: 

- An enumeration
- A bulleted list
- The subsections of a chapter

What do they have in common? They are all lists of things. When you have a list of things, the elements in the list . Such lists should be made out of elements of the same kind. 

The list above is such an example. 

A list in which one element does not belong is a hint that your conceptualization needs to be refined. 

Often there ar hints that the elements in a list do not belong together:


### 1. Unmatched Abstraction Levels

Take for example the following subsections from a report:

> Threats to validity
> 
> 1. Internal Validity
> 2. External Validity
> 3. Conclusion

The last item does not belong, because it's at a different abstraction level than the first two. It is a hint that our structure is broken and we have to improve it.


### 2. Visual Imbalance

When one element is markedly different than the others, there's probably a problem in your approach. E.g.
