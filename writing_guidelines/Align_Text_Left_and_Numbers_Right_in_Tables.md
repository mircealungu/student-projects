# Align Text Left and Numbers Right in Tables



**Align Text Left**

- It takes more work to read centered text when going from line to line 
- You are also more likely to lose your place 
- Users expect it [3]


> "By having a steady starting point for the eye to start scanning, the user can read much faster than when faced with centered or right-justified text. Of course, it is acceptable to center or right-justify a few lines for effect, but one should not do so for blocks of text." (Nielsen, Designing Web Usability, pp 126)



**Align Numbers Right**

- It's easier to compare
- If you have a decimal point, align to decimal [2]
- If you have thousands, separate thousand groups
