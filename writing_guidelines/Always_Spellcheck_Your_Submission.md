Spellcheck Your Submission
===

I am not your English teacher. I willÂ stop reading a thesis that has too 
many spelling and grammar errors. 

Everybody makes mistakes, and in fifty pages, it is normal that mistakes 
will sneak in. However, you have no excuse for spelling errors that
are so simple that could have been caught by an automatic spellchecker. 
E.g.

> __This aspects__ affects not only large projects but also small ones.

Did you mean "this aspect" or "these aspects"? I can't focus on the 
important idea that you're trying to convey if I'm stopping at every
sentence wondering what did you mean. And you want my feedback on the
important, high-level ideas in your thesis, not on your English. 

**How to Ensure This**: 

* Have a native English speaker review your text. If you can't 
do that, then

* Run your text through an automated spellchecker before submitting 
your draft. Use both the following two spellcheckers: 

  1. Grammarly (the web application, not the Chrome extension). 
    Create a free account on [app.grammarly.com](app.grammarly.com).
    You don't have to get the paid version: if you address the observations in the free 
    version, your text should already be much more readable. 
  2. Word. It will catch some problems that Grammarly will not, so please paste your 
    text in it too and take care of the highlighted problems.
