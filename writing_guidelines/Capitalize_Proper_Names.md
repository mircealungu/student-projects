Capitalize Proper Nouns
===

The following are proper nouns, and thus capitalized:

- Python
- Git

Both of them have also corresponding command line executables that are lowecased (i.e. `python` and `git`). However, when you're writing in a text about the systems you should use the uppercase spelling.
