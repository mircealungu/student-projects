If I have to see it, it is not in the Appendix
=== 


Appendix is for material that I might want to see or I might not want to see. 
If I have to see it, then it's not appendix.

Look at the following example: 

> As we can see in Figure 5 (see Appendix A) our tool UI is split in two parts...

Should Figure 5 be in Appendix? Nope. I can't keep reading without looking at Figure 5. You're talking about it here. So i have to see it to understand the main message. 
Thus, the figure should be here, not in the appendix.
