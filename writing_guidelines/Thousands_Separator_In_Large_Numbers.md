Thousands Separator in Large Numbers
==== 

Makes reading the text much easier. E.g. 

>  Endpoint A has was been called  3333857 times while B only 1122223 times.

is much harder to read than using comma, the thousands separator used in English [1]: 

>  Endpoint A has was been called  3,333,857 times while B only 1,122,223 times.
