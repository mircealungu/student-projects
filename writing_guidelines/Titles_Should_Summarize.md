# Titles Should Summarize

Any title should summarize the text it heads: be it a section, a chapter, or a report / thesis.

The following are not cool:
- thesis title proposals that are using a word that never occurrs in the text
- chapters that promise to talk about Refactoring but then in the chapter half of the text is about usability
- titles that promise more than what they deliver (e.g. Evolution of Dockerfiles in Open Source when in practice it was not in Open Source, but in this very specific set of systems)
- titles that are so general as to not give any idea what's the section about (e.g. Considerations)

To ensure that the title summarizes you have to either change the content or the title... and usually the title is easier :)


*Heuristic*: 
- If a term from the title does not appear in the body of the text, probably it should not appear in the title either.
- If you're studying only one subject or a handful of subjects, you might be doing a Case Study, so consider making this explicit in the title
