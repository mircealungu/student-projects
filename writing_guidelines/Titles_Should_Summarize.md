# Titles Should Summarize

Any title should summarize the text it heads. 

I've seen:
- thesis title proposals that were using a word that never occurred in the text
- chapters that promise to talk about Refactoring but then in the chapter half of the text is about usability
- titles that promise more than what they deliver (e.g. Evolution of Dockerfiles in Open Source when in practice it was not in Open Source, but in this very specific set of systems)
- titles that are so general as to not give any idea what's the section about (e.g. Considerations)

In such situations, to ensure that the title summarizes, either change the content or the title... And usually the title is easier :)


*Heuristic*: If a term from the title does not appear in the body of the text, probably it should not appear in the title either.
