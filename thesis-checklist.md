# Checklist before submitting


## Appendices at the end of the main document
Make sure that the appendices are in the same .pdf document as the main text; 
the ITU submission system seems to suggest that there's a different upload for 
the appendeix; ths is stupid and hopefully we'll change it at some point.


## Publish Datasets
Make sure that the datasets that you used for your work are accessible.
Making the raw data available is important for transparency and reproducibility. 
A Google spreadsheet is ok; but if possible, uploading it in a GH repository
as XLS or CSV increases the chance of that data being available in the future.

## Write an individual contributions section
