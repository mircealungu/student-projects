## How to write well?
- aim to ensure that every paragraph starts with the main idea; and the remainder of the paragraph is there to only support the main idea
- see the [writing guidelines in this repo](./writing_guidelines/README.md)

## How to design a survey?
- Start by looking for previous surveys that try to answer your question or a similar question
- If there are multiple previous surveys, consider grouping questions (see methodology in "The Shifting Sands of Motivation" by Gerosa et al.)
- Likert items or Likert scales? Scales are more powerful than items (https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/64457/likert-scales-analyzing-scales-or-items)
