## This Repository

This repository contains information for student projects. Some of the projects are flexible in the sense of they can be expanded to as Master's thesis for two students but also compressed to a bachelor thesis of one person. However, first, find a topic that's interesting for you and then let's talk. Also, after having seen the kind of topics that are interesting for me, feel free to propose something that you think might be of interest that is missing. 

## Active Research Prototypes

I usually have several active research project prototypes that are created by students and I play more the role of product owner of (although sometimes also maintainer). 

The currently active projects are: 

- [**Live Architectural Diagrams**](https://github.com/archlens) - simple way of specifying architectural diagrams that allows them to always be up to date
- [**Zeeguu**](projects/zeeguu.md) - personalized adaptive reading and vocabulary practice online
- [**Flask Monitoring Dashboard**](projects/flask-monitoring-dashboard.md) - a lightweight API monitor for Flask/Python systems 
- [**Git-Truck**](projects/git-truck.md) - visualizing git repositories for fun and profit
- [**Aiki**](projects/aiki.md) - a browser extension that uses procrastination for good


If you think that the idea of any of these is nice and you'd be interested in taking a given project and bringing it to the next level let me know. We should be able to define something together.

Please browse through the categories that are interesting for you and [contact me](https://mircealungu.github.io/#contact) if you find one that you think you might want to work on. Also, feel free to comment on the issues if you have questions. There are also issues marked as stub which are not very well defined yet. However, feel free to browse through them to see whether a project title is interesting for you.
