## This Repository

This repository contains information for student projects. Some of the projects are flexible in the sense of they can be expanded to as Master's thesis for two students but also compressed to a bachelor thesis of one person. However, first, find a topic that's interesting for you and then let's talk. Also, after having seen the kind of topics that are interesting for me, feel free to propose something that you think might be of interest that is missing.

Please browse through the categories that are interesting for you and [contact me](https://mircealungu.github.io/#contact) if you find one that you think you might want to work on. Also, feel free to comment on the issues if you have questions. There are also issues marked as stub which are not very well defined yet. However, feel free to browse through them to see whether a project title is interesting for you.
